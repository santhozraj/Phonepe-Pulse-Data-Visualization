# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization
Overview:

This project focuses on extracting, processing, and visualizing data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The goal is to transform raw metrics into valuable insights presented through an interactive dashboard. The process involves scripting to clone the GitHub repository, using Python and Pandas for data transformation, mysql-connector-python for database insertion, and Streamlit with Plotly for dashboard creation. The final result is a live geo visualization dashboard with dropdown options for customization and real-time updates from the MySQL database, accessible via web browsers. Through this project, the team has gained experience in data extraction, processing, and visualization, along with database management, dashboard creation, and project deployment. The project draws inspiration from PhonePe Pulse's commitment to data-driven insights, showcasing the power of data analytics in driving informed decisions.
